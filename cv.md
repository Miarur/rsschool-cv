## About myself

---------------
 I am an interesting, energetic, positive, communicative, responsible, and creative guy. I know the basics of HTML, CSS, and Java Script. In my free time, I read popular scientific books, go to the swimming pool, and hope to learn how to play the guitar.Capable of working independently and as a good "team player."For five years, I was the sales manager, and for one year, I hadÂ a small project in Poland.But I realized that this one was not for me. Why did I decide to be a programmer? because this speciality is closer to me.
